http://dev.to looks like it's a great place to post developer content

but the post editor does not allow you to paste images from the clipboard

this is a chrome extension to let you ctrl+v copied images
it handles automatically uploading, then insertion where your cursor is


p.s. I'm not a javascript developer so these are not good examples of best practices.
